Look, you can have this. Free of charge. Do whatever you want with it—use it, break it, modify
it, sell it to venture capitalists who don't read code, merge it into your corporate monorepo,
sublicense it to your enemies. We don't care. It's yours now. Congratulations? Condolences?
Depends on what you do with it.

The only thing we ask: keep this copyright notice and permission text in any copies or
"substantial portions" of the software. That's it. That's the rule. One rule. You can follow
one rule.

Here's the important part, and we cannot stress this enough:

THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS." THAT MEANS EXACTLY WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE. IT WORKS ON OUR
MACHINES. PROBABLY. NO WARRANTIES. NOT EXPRESS. NOT IMPLIED. NOT EVEN THE VAGUE PROMISE THAT IT
WON'T SET YOUR PRODUCTION SERVER ON FIRE. WE MAKE NO GUARANTEES ABOUT MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE (ESPECIALLY NOT RUNNING A TODO APP ON NETCAT), OR ANYTHING ELSE YOUR
LAWYERS WANT TO HEAR.

IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG—AND LET'S BE HONEST, YOU'RE LOOKING AT BASH MICROSERVICES—WE ARE NOT
LIABLE. NOT FOR DAMAGES. NOT FOR CLAIMS. NOT FOR THAT WEIRD THING YOUR BOSS SAYS AFTER THEY SEE
THE ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM. WHETHER IT'S A CONTRACT ISSUE, A TORT, OR SOMETHING ELSE ENTIRELY,
THAT'S A YOU PROBLEM.

You wanted chaos. Here it is. Enjoy.
